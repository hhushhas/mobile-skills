# Apple: App Store Connect via asc

`asc` (rorkai) is the primary tool. Update it before serious submission work (`brew upgrade asc`), check auth with `asc auth doctor`, and use `--output json` for anything you'll parse. Auth is App Store Connect API key via env/profile: `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (or `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY`/`_B64`), `ASC_APP_ID`. The `.p8` key is downloadable exactly once from App Store Connect — make sure the human stores it in a secret manager at creation time. Team keys require Account Holder or Admin to create, under Users and Access > Integrations > App Store Connect API. When the CLI lacks coverage, `asc schema` plus `asc auth token` give you a direct authenticated API path; check current Apple API docs before hand-rolling calls. `asc search` and `asc docs` answer command-discovery questions from the binary itself. For deep metadata, localization, screenshot, or pricing work, the CLI ships a companion skill pack (`rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills`) — register the skills you need in your skill manager (skillbox here) rather than installing them into an agent's global skills directory.

## Flow

```bash
asc apps list --bundle-id <bundle> --output json     # resolve app id
asc status --app <app-id> --include app,builds,testflight,appstore,submission,review
asc builds upload --app <app-id> --ipa <path>
asc builds wait --app <app-id> --latest              # upload succeeded ≠ build usable
asc validate --app <app-id> --version <version>
asc publish testflight --app <app-id>
asc publish appstore --app <app-id> --version <version> --submit --confirm
asc submit status --version-id <version-id>          # poll review state
```

Validate before publishing (`asc validate`; the old `asc submit preflight` is deprecated). Default flow is TestFlight first, then App Review when asked. A build's first distribution to an *external* TestFlight group triggers Beta App Review — a lighter, separate review with its own delay; internal groups need none. If `asc` upload fails, Transporter (which accepts the same API keys) and Xcode Organizer are the fallback upload paths — binary upload is not available via plain REST.

## Build

Ask the signing question before building: local certificates/profiles vs cloud (EAS) — don't guess. After Expo prebuild or any native regeneration, re-check entitlements and the build number; prebuild can silently reset them. Verify the exported IPA's bundle ID, version, and build number match what you intend before uploading. The App Store icon ships inside the binary's asset catalog (1024×1024, opaque) — changing only the icon still means a new build and version through review.

## Console boundary

`asc capabilities` prints the live coverage map — every capability tagged cli-supported / partial / experimental-web / not-public-api, with commands and next actions; trust it over any written list. The durable facts: agreements, tax, banking, identity, API-key creation, and role grants are account-owner-only. App record creation and the App Privacy questionnaire are web-only — `asc web apps create` and `asc web privacy` exist but the CLI itself labels them experimental and discouraged, so prefer browser automation or the human. App Privacy must be *published* before an App Review submission will go through.

## Readiness judgment points

The ones reviewers actually catch: account creation without in-app account deletion (hard rejection); third-party login without Sign in with Apple where required; vague permission purpose strings; App Privacy answers that don't match the SDKs actually compiled in; digital goods sold outside IAP; no working demo/reviewer access for gated features (give credentials and exact steps in review notes); UGC without report/block; screenshots showing states the reviewer can't reach.
